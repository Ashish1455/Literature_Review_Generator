# Literature Review Generator

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a literature review generator that takes scientific research papers as input and creates a summary. The system uses MapReduce to create chunks and distilbart-cnn-12-6 model for generating summaries.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Advanced text preprocessing using NLTK to improve data quality.
- **Summarization Model**: Utilizes distilbart-cnn-12-6 for precise and efficient summarization.
- **Scalable Chunking**: Employs MapReduce for efficient data chunking.

## Deployment
We are planning to deploy this application on Streamlit to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface.
- **Develop Streamlit Interface**: Create a user-friendly interface using Streamlit.
- **Integrate Modules**: Incorporate text preprocessing and summarization modules into the Streamlit application.
